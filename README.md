# Feature Matching and Image Alignment

This project demonstrates **feature matching**, **homography computation**, and **image alignment** using **OpenCV**. It identifies common points between two images, computes a transformation matrix, and warps one image to align it with the other. The process is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file).

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are used in this project:
- **OpenCV**: For image processing, feature detection, matching, and perspective transformation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the results.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical operations and data structures.

This project can be applied to various fields, such as Image Alignment and Registration, where it is used to align images for purposes like medical imaging, remote sensing, and document processing.
